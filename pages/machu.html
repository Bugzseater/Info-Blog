                Machu Picchu, often called the "Lost City of the Incas," is one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the world. Located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, at an elevation of about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet), it was built in the 15th century by the Inca emperor Pachacuti. Machu Picchu is renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone construction, with terraced fields, temples, palaces, and over 150 structures set against breathtaking mountain views.

                Rediscovered in 1911 by American explorer Hiram Bingham, Machu Picchu remains a symbol of the ingenuity and architectural mastery of the Inca civilization. Scholars believe it served as a royal estate or sacred religious site due to its secluded location and proximity to important mountains, which the Incas considered sacred.
                <br><br>
                Machu Picchu's most famous landmarks include the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana stone (believed to be an ancient astronomical clock or calendar), and the Room of the Three Windows. The site is also famous for its advanced agricultural terraces and sophisticated water management systems, which allowed the Incas to farm in a high-altitude environment.
                <br><br>
                Declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983 and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, Machu Picchu attracts millions of visitors every year, eager to explore its mysteries and majestic beauty.
