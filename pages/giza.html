                The Great Pyramid of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt, is one of the most iconic and enduring symbols of human achievement. 
                Built around 4,500 years ago during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops),
                 it is the largest of the three pyramids in the Giza complex and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

            <p class="full-description">
                Standing at an original height of 146.6 meters (481 feet), the pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. 
                It consists of approximately 2.3 million limestone blocks, each weighing several tons, meticulously placed to form the massive structure. 
                The precision of its construction continues to amaze archaeologists and engineers, 
                as the ancient Egyptians achieved this monumental feat without modern tools or technology.
                <br><br>
                The pyramid served as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu, and its intricate design includes internal chambers, 
                passageways, and air shafts. It is part of a larger funerary complex that includes smaller pyramids, temples, and the famous Great Sphinx.
                <br><br>
                The Great Pyramid of Giza stands as a testament to the architectural prowess of ancient Egypt and remains one of the worldâ€™s most visited and studied historical 
                landmarks, 
                drawing millions of tourists and scholars each year.
