                The Great Wall of China is one of the most impressive and iconic structures in human history. Stretching over 13,000 miles, it was built to protect ancient Chinese states and empires from invasions and raids by nomadic tribes. Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BC, but the most famous sections were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).

                The wall is made of various materials, including stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood, depending on the region and availability of resources. It snakes across diverse landscapes, from deserts and mountains to grasslands, creating an awe-inspiring sight. The wall’s height averages 20 to 30 feet, with watchtowers strategically placed along its length for defensive purposes.
