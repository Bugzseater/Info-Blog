The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is one of the most beautiful and renowned monuments in the world. Built between 1632 and 1653 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it was constructed as a mausoleum in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. This white marble masterpiece is widely considered a symbol of eternal love and an architectural wonder.

                The Taj Mahal's design blends Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles, featuring an enormous central dome, intricately carved marble walls, and stunning inlaid gemstones. The central tomb is surrounded by four minarets, symmetrical gardens, reflecting pools, and various other structures, including a mosque and guest house.

                The interior of the Taj Mahal is equally impressive, with delicate marble latticework, floral motifs, and calligraphy from the Quran adorning the walls. The main chamber houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, while their actual graves lie in a crypt below.
                <br><br>
                Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, the Taj Mahal is visited by millions of tourists from around the globe each year. Its timeless beauty, romantic history, and architectural brilliance make it one of the most celebrated monuments in the world and a symbol of Indiaâ€™s rich cultural heritage.
